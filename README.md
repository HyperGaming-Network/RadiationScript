# RadiationScript
Original RadiationScript on for GMod on HGN from 2007 Onwards before we moved to a Nexus ( clockwork base ) and then later on my custom WorldScript 2 base

I developed this for the HyperGaming Network community from 2006 - 2009/2010 Before creating a new script.

This is version: RadiationScript Beta 1.5a

This script will not function in the latest version of garrysmod and i decided to upload this as a monument, a tribute to the community, staff and all the blood, sweat and tears hat went into maintaining a large gaming community based around the s.t.a.l.k.e.r universe.
